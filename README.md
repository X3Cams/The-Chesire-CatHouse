Madame Montcomery and The Cheshire CatHouse: What's Down this Rabbit Hole?

Hi, Welcome to my new world. This is an uncharted land where nothing is as it seems. Alice can't help you We're not it Kansas and we never were. You won't hallucinate an armyof cards or a funny man in a top hat... No that Hatted funny man is, to our misfortune very much real. Ant Put that down will you?! You'll cause a tremor. You know who's been looking for you. I suggest you go find him before he starts a mess even you can't clean up!

This is the new project environment, a steam punk brothel with a Wonderland twist... or maybe kink... who knows, really? It's one where I am tutoringa developler to be. To make it fun (at least for my-self) I'm turning it into my own worlda steampunk world with guests you may reacognize here and there. We will be discovering CodeIgniter's mobility, flexibility and have a hands on experience with an MVCD framework. To top it off, I'm not sure how much of this will make it into my documentation being a separate paret of the same praject but I am on the trial of Google Coud Platform and and enjoying new discoveries that are coming along with that!

Copyright for now on this currently as I have no idea what we will create but likely not much worth borrowing, maybe a UI if we're lucky. If we do happen wind up with something worth sharing I will likely add a license so that it can be shared. For now, I want the freedome of using thing that my own that I don't necessarily want in public domain but may be good for teaching. But like I said, If we really come up with something to contribute, we'll most likely share it.

Later dayz
